We will finalize this file once we get closer to finishing the 3rd project. Before submission, this file should contain:

1.  A brief description of the purpose of the repo  
2.  A list of R packages used  
3.  Links to the generated analyses  
4.  The code used to create the analyses from a single .Rmd file (i.e. the render() code)
